# LangChain AI Agent

This project is an AI agent framework built with [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), designed for rapid prototyping and integration of LLM-powered agents. It is set up for easy extension with tools like Ollama and Chroma for LLM inference and vector storage.

## Features
- **LangChain-based agent architecture**
- Ready for integration with Ollama (local LLMs) and Chroma (vector DB)
- Minimal, extensible project structure

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd loc_AI_Agent
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended)
#### On Windows (cmd):
```sh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
#### On PowerShell:
```sh
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Project Structure
```
loc_AI_Agent/
├── requirements.txt
├── main.py           # (Create your entrypoint here)
├── .github/
│   └── copilot-instructions.md
└── README.md
```

### 5. Usage
- Add your agent code in `main.py` or organize modules as needed.
- Follow LangChain's documentation for building agents, chains, and tools.
- Update `requirements.txt` if you add new dependencies.

## Development Tips
- Use clear, descriptive names for agents, chains, and tools.
- If you add tests, use `pytest` and place them in a `tests/` directory.
- Document new modules and workflows in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## Integrations
- **LangChain**: Core agent and workflow framework
- **Ollama**: For local LLM inference (see [Ollama docs](https://ollama.com/))
- **Chroma**: For vector storage/retrieval (see [Chroma docs](https://docs.trychroma.com/))

## Contributing
1. Commit your changes:
   ```sh
   git add .
